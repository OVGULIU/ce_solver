# Compress and Eliminate solver

This is a Fortran + Python implementation of the [Compress and Eliminate](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09133v2) (CE) factorization. It is approximate sparse triangular factorization for the symmetric positive definite matrix that can be used either as a low-accuracy solver or as a preconditioner.

## Installation

```
sh compile.sh
```


## Requirenments

The minimum requirement by CE is [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/).

## Quick Start

You can find Jupyter notebook with examples in folder "examples".
